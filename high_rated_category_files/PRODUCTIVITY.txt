App Name: Business Calendar 2
Rating: 4.6
Reviews: I like basic version OK--nice colors decent syncing across apps--but I would upgrade paid pro version, someone would confirm whether ALARM notification feature--i.e., actul wake-up type alarm, NOT one-time vibration pop-up window--can easily set notifications. It's little pricey that's feature I would really looking upgrade, I can't tell that's actually included not.; Easily best calendar I ever used; syncs seamlessly Google Calendar Tasks (both backbone short- long-term planning), extends functionality without bloated dubiously useful features. I especially appreciate fact task lists include sub-tasks. My complaint appear desktop extension, since online time spent mobile tablet, minor complaint indeed.; Just great calendar app. Love dark theme, visual layout, agenda widget (!), tasks events easy set up, customizable (including recurrence, though takes getting used to), sync calendar subscriptions (I found regional holidays, I'm interested others too), shows/hides local Google calendars, on. They even offer (pay) calendar subs sports/tv, want (not now, interesting option).; Up 5 minutes ago problem I widget home screen would delete occasionally. 5 minutes ago, scanning events upcoming weeks widget, every event I manually entered deleted itself. Everything. Edit: I went redo calender everything reappeared. Changed 3/5 heart attack gave me.; I've REALLY want stick BC I start, But UI less user friendly rival Calengoo (has view tabs much customizable), harder switch views, harder select individual calendar task lists (especially using phone portrait view many lists/calendars .. Calengoo individual calendar buttons multiple rows ). Also secondly, biggie me, selecting task widget "task list" view, actually separate different task list headers (like Calengoo successfully), makes useless me. Selecting "Task Lists" give TASK LISTS widget!! Overall good app, looks nice, lacks lot functionality. I've tried communicating devs, ... hope listen. I feel like I'm forced go elsewhere, functionality must come first.
