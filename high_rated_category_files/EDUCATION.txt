App Name: English with Lingualeo
Rating: 4.7
Reviews: Jobs are completely different than in the web version. Not speaking about an opportunity to begin the task with pc, and to continue with a mob. It's hard to imagine how an application can be useful to me.; In general, I like the service. And the application looks slightly underworked. There is not enough to display the daily progress as on the site - how much Leo ate.; The application is good, but there are some bugs. A page with tasks and a moment is loaded for a long time. The voice acting could be at a higher level. It is very difficult sometimes to grasp the essence because of the announcer. Uduchite this moment please, really want to buy a premium version and get high-quality content. And so everything is super.; I do not recommend it. Has paid money it is not clear for what. Support does not respond either through the site or through email.; The application is buggy and does not respond to the command to reset progress in the courses.
