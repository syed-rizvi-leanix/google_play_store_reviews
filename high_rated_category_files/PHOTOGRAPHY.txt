Reviews: I love thing want fliter part cant choose tho already existing photos. It makes take pic right there. Most let u fliter already taken photos.. So u cpuld fix wouls perfect. Bc like sit n go tho old pic iv taken tho day n fix um; Just last year, features incredibly awesome, downloading again(for I reformatted phone) annoying one. Every feature must manually downloaded, tedious Work do, add popping saying need write review app. The worse part special feature app, splicing feature, here. I know happen guys(Developers), can't great job updating, it. I suggest returning older version. Don't scumbag.; Unable import pictures! What developers thinking? I liked the b&w filters better app. Now important pictures want edit. So really bad update; I would rate better every time get Add pops up. Never seen many ads before. Maybe offer add-free version, paid? If change 5 stars.; The would great ads pop almost every time change pages. I know guys wanna make revenue, c'mon charge app, permanent ad removal fee. Otherwise, interesting layout.
