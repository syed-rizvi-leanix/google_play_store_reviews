Reviews: I love concept, every aspect slow buggy. Uploads, preview, connecting camera, amd almost features struggle. I constantly notifications telling uploads cloud process neverend there. I want great I really enjoy Hero 5, great connecting direct PC; Only used far, connecting took finally got resetting times. Not sure phone I always seem struggle connect devices. lot features Hero 2018 (the basic one) I imagine feature rich flagship models. Not bad now, we'll see goes.; This poorly designed obvious bugs. My GoPro reads connected actually complete connection matter many re-starts, closing program, even uninstalling reinstalling it. Very disappointed. Also, support offer page rediculous. It difficult.; Must agree many here, difficult use, difficult connect Hero 4, camera password, PIN, stubborn connections, connection errors, creating account demanding location services customers simply view videos intrusive rife struggles. Easier simply plug micro SD device. Shame.; Wow! Total Junk! If hopes reliably controlling accessing GoPro session 5 forget it. Only connects 10% time. The 90% waste 30 minutes trying get connect give up. Complete waste time. Shame them. Crappy, crappy, crappy. Hate app/camera - completely unreliable.

That separate issue. All templates downloads in-app show I can't features app. Sigh. After several years using this, I install something else.; Finally decided try out. I love easy add text Save button ant exit stop ask want save image not. I tried twice results. It saves image lower resolution text gone. Useless.; Barely worth & mind hit w/ ads every clicks. Hint: Disable Wi-Fi using spare frustration... plus, screws maker revenue. They deserve it.; I like it. It takes much space. And everyone complaint adds WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? THIS IS FREE THEY HAVE TO PUT IN ADDS SO THEY GET PAYED BY EACH ADD. STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT ADS!!!!!!!!

Before last two three updates It excelent Application write Pics. But now.; The says. The color choosing system perfect inclusive. I never uninstall app. Some minor problems- 1. The upper line text line text overlaps other. 2. When I return sharing photo app, editing disappears. 3. The text input area small hard edit text enter it. 4. Most fonts useless unreadable, add two three readable fonts please, thanks.; Annoying arcade games sound effects taking pleaure struggling messy interface new heights, ads added incentive The fires sounds enabled, annoying enough, sounds seem straight poorly made puzzle game. Once get past that, find editing tools pretty rough need much patience smallest bit text want type. I could explored little longer hope discovering aspects makes Google bring top results text image, I settled wasting time writing review instead. I ads blocked rooted phone, I'm sure fantastic deal get 20meg , ads must adding fun experience using app.; Sure wish better selection type faces, kinda limited... real good purpose..; I like app. It's perfect professional looking photo editing, meme making, captioning. It even allows put contrasting colored border around picture make easier read multi-color backgrounds. 5 stars!
