Ive talked customer yet still cant give money back get design make business cards. Id give stars possible.; I making festival; birthday wishes; election campaign posters etc n great n easy. But I language Telugu Hindi font style monotonous English fonts variety. This flaw may plz b fixed. Plz add You Tube channel / banner art templates.; It can't even save stupid image without freaking out. It re-download image time. Ridiculous. Took 10 minutes save stupid little image. Trash; Don't sync phone PC : Don't show images. Take 1000 years export I got least 2 pages send error. Make Canva great I'm annoyed bugs. Can also add possibility page instead ? Would nice.
