Reviews: The good episode instead going next whole reset. I stopped using 4 months I return surprise surprise STILL thing.; I want like whose lines, buggy casting TV. I recommend looking loading method switches casting. Also, try handle video quality more, default low quality instead buffering constantly. Last, make sure latest episode advertising social media.; While I appreciate getting watch episodes free, experience simply terrible. I 100 mbps connection yet video keeps getting stuck, trying cast. Often casting stop itself, would resume, casting again. When happens, I see ad again. Great intention, terrible implementation.; It let resume I season, tried episode I said failed I restart it. So multiple times still work uninstalled it.; I phone well firestick... lagging reset load next episode place watch John Constantine always lags freezes stops could great right needs lot work lot many ads
