Reviews: I Used Love This App. Ok I SO LOVE BEING ABLE 2 SEE THE HUMIDITY. U developers constantly change things up. WHY WHY WHY When U great layout people happy U tinker it. I SOOO LOVED THE OLD ONE. THE LIGHT DARK Color day n night easy read. The white n grey gotta go. PLUS clicked info see humidity. They OPENED UP NOW YOU HAVE TO CLICK EACH ONE SO DISLIKE THiS LAYOUT THINKING IF INSTALLING IT.; Great app; needs resizable. I've used years across many devices versions Android. I love it, development seems dropped late. New bugs appear fixed new Android update. The latest, reason I've moved away it, can't resized fit 5-wide layout Nexus 6. Still great smaller devices, though.; Good but..... I really like look options widgets. The reason I giving 3 stars sometimes stop updating. The time temperature freeze. I reload widget get working again. If gets fixed, I would give 5 stars. Galaxy S5; Was all-time favorite This go every phone last 5 phone time update I'm going go look another app. Very disappointed!; Wow! I love widget allows fully customize assign launch functions! At first clicking clock nothing I able manually assign clock action. So many options, including opaqueness optimizing data usage. Great job developers!
