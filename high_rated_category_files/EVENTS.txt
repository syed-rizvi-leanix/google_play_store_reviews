Rating: 4.5
Reviews: It great going purchase tickets.. Do sell tickets. They RIP keep money. They sold 360 dollar tickets 120 bucks .. lesson learned I guess; Watch out. They label anything like preseason playoffs. Turns I paid regular season prices preseason game. Customer rude refused refund full amount, offering 75%. Uninstalling soon I sell tickets, currently let attempt. What joke. Just pick 12 ticket services avoid company. You're better off.; Never problem till now. I bought tickets week prior event. Then sell them. An I didnt even get half back I paid. Seriously. That rip off. Like I said never problem before. But got majority money taken cool. Changing another Now chatting customer service. They tell nothing do. An said basically thank hard earned money short word description try get money back. Dumping changing. No wonder ranked #5. An think I thought different 1 point; Don't like see show, go back, start search beginning... I love app...; I love it, wonders, fast, easy, convenient. I love I send friends family tickets instead print out.
