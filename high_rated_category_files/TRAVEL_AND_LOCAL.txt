Reviews: Used Florence Rome much success. Love placing pins marking visited. Best feature locator map. I able find way easily I took wrong turn. Would love able map route A B. Also think different colored stars available. For example red site visit green example restaurants.; I've using traveling Europe US. Saved lot headaches. Easy practical! I also love I find anything I need - museums, cafes, restaurant much more.; Great app, used Hong Kong, Bangkok, Vietnam Singapore. It's definitely worth buying maps. With account manage trips PC Ipad (as I did) sync phone. Also great trip look back places visited. Only two minor downsides (for me): - can't differently colored pins map different categories (restaurants/ hotels ...) - can't copy names places; I used iphone, Pro version, helpful holidays. Since changed phone can't anymore. I buy Pro version. Not good solution.; Used find almost everything wanted vacation. We Halifax long time needed once. By Michael Koch

Reviews: Displays large Applebee logos OVER top gas station I'm trying see. Really? No way find gas stations ahead me. Also shows gas stations behind me. I'm driving back 10 miles wrong direction buy gas. Searching distance needs take account direction. Also, gas station logos appear map. rated mature audiences only. Really?; I hate app. I wish comparable alternatives. This used excellent ads, I suppose developer got greedy sucks. Now hogs way space, ram bandwidth, unnecessarily. It also takes twice long load functions people even care need which, addition ads, add bloat program.; No longer shows correct price first list comes up. Even updated. Shows correct price station selected, go station see actual prices. Terrible.; It add along route prices regular gas diesel earn alot accolades. Just searching nearby help people likes plan trip ahead; MAJOR, FLAGRANT PRIVACY VIOLATION This enabled feature called "trips", could location mandatory. This feature recorded every time I went anywhere: I started left. They ago OPTED ME IN sale personal info third parties I way reclaiming info. So made money selling personal movements, home place work. All without asking. On top feature drains battery. Screw you, parasites .

Reviews: UPDATE: Please, please bring back ability save individual flights. This extremely useful. After latest update saved flights, upto 6 months, future wiped. A fantastic app. My go fight fares, 2 years. But, recently, latest update I think, I still constantly recieve price updates fares I deleted favourites weeks ago. Slightly annoying. Why Momondo?; Fake prices! Clicked link book flight flight $500 shows app. Did another search hour later another destination following link turned flight, surely buy expensive similar dates times. Seems like bait switch me.; I generally like but, upgrade I guess, I see option save favorite flights. I really miss feature. I often check flight prices dates multiple times upcoming trips want re-search options every time.; I know work anymore.. mean realy realy try make search.. good one.. try open link booking site directs momondo.. nothing..; Fake price . When pay , final price £50-£60 higher. If pay attention, find paid much anywhere else .

Reviews: **WORKS GREAT Sitting airport waiting mother law, can't find her, look flight rubbing behind. Next thing I know calling landed. So yes works, type airline first :-); This good tracking flight. It's extremely slow annoying. Searching flights booking hassle; better going directly airline's website. If bloated unnecessary garbage it'd probably run whole lot smoother, making useful tool. I purchased premium version hoping would run better, no.. so, save money.; One functional helpful travel I used BUT seems way contacting developers. There several airline carriers included. How get added?; Crap Wants way much personal info. Endless ads. Never could get past trying figure I was. Needing "pin" protect "account" bad sign since I want yet another "account" somewhere.; Useful but... Built takes external sites maps unusable buggy. Give us option external browser, I rerate.
