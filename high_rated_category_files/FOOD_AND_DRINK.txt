App Name: BigOven Recipes, Meal Planner, Grocery List & More
Rating: 4.3
Reviews: I multiple times per week. I like able search new recipes, grocery list included great. I wish grocery list combined like items (For example, recipe called 2 eggs another 3 eggs, I wish list would recognize I need 5 eggs, instead creating two separate line items). The meal planning work well phone desktop version, I'm sure could fixed easily. Overall, favorite/most used apps.; Cannot recommend anyone seriously interested cooking. Not possible edit imported recipes. Web clipped recipes still advertisements them. Measurements sometimes wrong. Cannot import one's scanned handwritten recipes unless pay extra it. Extremely limited menu editing possibilities. All even WITH PRO version!; I would love except meal planner bug makes unusable. It missing 6 months history November-March calendar sometimes meal plans get marked different day I set to. I also wish I could set broad "healthy" preference even though I'm restrictive diet like Paleo vegan. Love ability search recipes clean fridge.; Is useful. The fact US orientated irritating, eg matching food ingredients recipes recognises US names foods. Many recipes US 'style'. Would good able filter recipes eg calorie content, although limited often nutritional info wrong ingredients linked correctly. Useful planning.; Like ability import recipes Web suggested recipes, convenient go original instructions. Coming pepperplate, I would really like see improvement grocery list, like able organize aisles store able easily add categories...you type custom categories every time instead able select list.
