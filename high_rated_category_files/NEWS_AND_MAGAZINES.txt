Reviews: I think terrific. I've recommended friends thinking cutting cord cut cord miss news programs can't get locally. Here Las Vegas Get 60 plus channels proper antenna. But adds watch especially used getting many channels. I love it!!!; It's okay much buffering. Disappointed shows featured available. I think I might keep little longer give fair try, I update rating later, hopefully I able give 5 stars. We shall see.; All buffer. No matter channel playing. Video NEVER plays. Useless. Even updating. And stop w/all 'notifications', draining data. Get together guys. ANDROID ZTE. 8418, 2:07pm.; 5 stars could ask free app? You know adds free. It's streams good nice selection newer TV shows. Can't complain much app. It's free!; Update: (a minutes maneuvering app) This cannot right.If I cld watch TV shows minus 130$ bill, I'D BE IN HEAVEN! I HATE COX CABLE. AT&T EVEN MORE.This must beginners luck. Gimme till morning. Oh,I hope I'm dreaming! We know nothing life worth FREE, I'm abt prove it. Again.

Reviews: I flooded ads, redirected, news articles really hidden ads APK's, requires permissions. If allow permissions open. JUNK; No local updates multiple daily president wrong. Feels like trying make mind me. DELETE; I Love This It Sure Keeps You Updated About What's Going On In Your City So It's Really Helpful To Me.; Just like rest intolerant, liberal, left news. If want unbiased news, go somewhere else.; This joke I allowed access location even tried search city STILL have news another location. Sooo pointless would have less stars I could have.

Reviews: Overall great behind scenes, last couple weeks, someone decided start sending push notifications every single story. Baseball, category 1 hurricanes, usually 10+ larger event. Probably reinstalling let leave phone alone fifteen minutes I get pinged again.; I randomly get news alerts, great, I them, takes main app, story I clicked on. Sometimes, story even list stories available. The share function garbage. If I want share link, usable option copy clipboard paste I share it, requires delete title article links store Google play store copied URL I get article.; Content loads much faster latest update! AP great reputation accuracy objectivity. I used read Yahoo News (most AP stories anyway), got fed mean/ignorant user comments. This wonderful app: quick access quality news stories photos intuitive categories, rapid updates, etc. Fast, clean navigation stories.; Clicking "open" notification open story, homepage. Likewise stories "More AP" section bottom article pages regularly return "Content can't loaded" message. A 'just-the-facts, fast' news invaluable, there's point users can't access content.; The good. But, I problem getting local news feed settings save app. Also, I like timeline gaps features pages. It seems feed refreshes often enough. I normally still receive week old news I read it. That purges recent stories.
