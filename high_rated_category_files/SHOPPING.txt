Reviews: I think could revamped. There's way add receipts purchase forget stuck. Sometimes wants shop online already store gets confusing. The BEST feature linking cards stores. That helps forget go them. It get cash back even tiny bit adds up.; The Complaint I have, sometimes Cash Back Activity show I Re-enter Order Information. Now, I usually wait 2 Days, I still see money, I let Customer Service know money deposited Ebates Account almost immediately! Other that, I happier! This time around, time Cash Out, I given New 2nd Option Receiving EGift Card included "Added Boost 15% towards Cash Balance!". The EGift Cards Offered different Boost Amounts, 15%!!! For example, I ready Cash Out $11.64, I looked EGift Cards found Petco GREAT help, I ended getting Cash Out Boosted 12% so??? Anyway, instead getting $11.64 via PayPal, I received Petco EGift Card $13.15!!! I EXTREMELY happy jump Value.; Loved using update. After update, force closed least 10 times, can't get shopping session done anywhere.; I fine browsing mobile Ebates urged better cash back Installed 9% rebate mobile shrank 4.5% I better mobile site buy So compare may find coupon online sites instant discount; I love shop, & getting paid favorite past times, seems like win-win me!
