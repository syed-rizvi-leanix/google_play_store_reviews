App Name: Find&Save - Local Shopping
Rating: 4.0
Reviews: This used great first came out, longer worth time effort crappy pay outs. They started giving 5 10 bucks cash back 5 10% purchase cash back, good variety deals. I used frequently made 50 bucks. However, require watch 30 second video ad find deal & even worth get 1% cash back spend minimum 25 50 bucks! The worst part take $3 back savings every month remained "active" watching advertisement. This means lose little earned quickly check app. I pleased least write back send request, need make changes payment rules give good review.; This WAS great app. Now completely monetized benefit owners passing nearly non existent percentage user. When I hit next $3 $25 I'm deleting app. Of course rate pay out, it'll take another year. Oh, 30 second ads find store offer entales complete waste time!; Takes long reach $25.00 cash out. 1-3 3-5 business days see payback rarely happens! I think I reach $25 I'm deleting worth little return watching videos irrelevant shopping. Customer GREAT prompt need email them. That positive, I get Find&Save.; This sucks! I year still earned $25 needed check out. Upgraded Samsung S8 plus camera compatible receipts get rejected. Emailed support told email picture receipt happens. Another receipt rejected, emailed eipt support said full receipt. The thing missing credit/debit card info I folded receipt hide . They still refused process receipt even though problem processing receipts I hide crexit/debit card info. Deleting app!; This Terrible! I basically started Brand New & easy earn cash back & required watch advertisements. Now make watch commercials, view crappy cash back offers 1%-2%, please.
