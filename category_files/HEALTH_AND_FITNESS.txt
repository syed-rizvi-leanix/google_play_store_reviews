Reviews: Really enjoying app, find elements frustrating. Instead 'signing up' particular programme, I'd like see poses first. I programmes, complete (as challenging right equipment), activity seems lose track I've actually achieved. Think less issue I get grips poses. Really great way learn home though!; I went yoga class I really liked it. But work schedules unpredictable, that's difficult go class every then. So that's really good option me. It really relaxing! Love; Very greedy company. I recently buy silver pro plan time want move next purchase level. This soo un-satisfying. It seems cheating me. I think turned basic /free/ silver gold me. Not happy buying:-(; I really love layout app! I never exercise simple programs great voice coach makes want stick it! The reason four stars like many people intrusive ads pop even I'm using app! I hope gets fixed; The comprehensive complete program I've seen app. And affordable price. Loving it, simple, clean, fresh. Don't put longer. I LOVE NEW fresh interface. It keeps getting better better.

Reviews: I'm 39 year old woman I practice pole fitness, go traditional gym. I looking would help keep track days I go pole studio, built women mostly far easy. The workouts challenging app, especially get advanced levels, I appreciate. The 7×4 full body program mostly various types push ups, I love, good workout. The full body also include legs, I add leg workouts too. Overall, pretty good workout app, I would recommend men fit women.; Many thanks LFG great app. I looking suitable without-equipment plans I discovered app. I recommendation would improve app. According me, clear guide needed let everybody know start, day dedicated part (example: chest day 1, legs day 2...). This kind guide crucial beginners. Making several plans group would best. That way, people worry whether going right way not. I miss feature. I get exactly parts I day. I hope considered creators. Thanks again.; I love it. Even weightlifting brings whole new meaning word sore. I started advanced ended dropping intermediate first 3 minutes. Now feels like something I could get thru. Back challenges go thru diverse workouts multiple different excercises muscle group along good amount integrated stretching. Keep great work!; The good itself...the excercises good... however plans put impossible excercises... example...in push ups day..they give 6 pushups all, ok me... however plan, want us 14 hover push ups....i mean...i cant even 14 pushups properly...then u expect hovering too...fix pls; Really enjoyed it. Very easy I feel lot better fit already day. The problem many ads, I want pay any. But that's cost great free fitness app.
