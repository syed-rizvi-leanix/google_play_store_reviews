Rating: 3.8
Reviews: Excellent! I take brakes watching long content, always remembers I left off, fills bottom screen link resume I return. Launches fast, great movies timely content(John Oliver, Real Time, Vice). Maintains nice watch list, always up. Excellent! How 3.8? I know? Maybe expense, I DirecTV Now I'm advertisement, HBO $5 DirecTV Now consumers. It's great deal, I expect last long. Sorry I adore Westworld Game Thrones, appreciation influenced creative works. Said much I sound like advert. HBO brutally honest decades. There's nothing new here, except content that's meaningful timeless. Is business? Seemz like expression amazing people.; I give up, useless now. I've used years great success whatever recent update/change done makes terrible unusable tablets phones. I problems previous people posted. I waste time typing them, read reviews. Oh, NO, I contact tech support troubleshoot product you. This done release.; Constant repeated crashes multiple devices two years. Chromecast frustrating use. It randomly disconnect point controls stop working. At time resort Android "A device casting WiFi" controls. Then need disconnect, Force Stop reopen app. It's unfortunate HBO would release absolute trash.; After attempting fixes described help still says "unable play video. Tyr later." Have emailed hbogo customer suggested taking screen shot error. That funny since attempting screenshot says "unable capture screen. HRM protected image." I think I'm done playing. Galaxy note 3 Android version 5.0; Quit working Verizon. Sign page come up. Have idea talk this. UPDATE - I uninstalled app, turned tablet off, turned back reinstalled app. After worked great like used to. The developer responsive I'm happy camper again.

Reviews: Since last update keeps freezing, working closing. Please fix it. I love rating change I see problem solved; The worst watch movies ever I used. It slow, get freez lot time start remember old days PCs 286s 386.; It is very unstable. It takes a long time to open, it takes a long time to load any list of videos, it automatically shows you the next video once you finish one. It lacks a lot of optimization, it is terrible, but it is very bad, so they charge you $ 199 per month for having it? Better pay Netflix, it's multy platform, cheaper the content is better.; It works perfectly, but the movie selection leaves a lot to be desired. Apart it is much more expensive than others that have better variety. And there are the Fox sport; From bad to worse, after the last update I can already stream, start for 5 seconds then turn off my computer, this is only with your since I use as HBO the streaming is done well transmits without problem on my tv.
