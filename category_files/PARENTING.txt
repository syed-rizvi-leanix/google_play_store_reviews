Reviews: My kids love; It's best; My daughter kids Kindle fire using Amazon Freetime on. Because I returning tablet slow constant freezing I thought would good idea Freetime phone let time time. But nothing like program actual Kindle. It offer videos says I share things purchased Amazon. The actual Freetime Kindle countless kids shows books children 6. Not worth money Android phone/tablet.; It geared towards older children already read. It job lock device, better available task. The content section needs help. As others stated way search specific content, scrolling cover art books & videos. When set youngest setting (3-5 yrs old) book selection includes full juvenile chapter books like Harry Potter -- making setting useless. The video section also includes content age appropriate (3-5 yr old). While analytics offered child's activities great, would useful older children. I see child spent two seconds many books, chapter books, text well beyond abilities age setting selected. I likely keep subscription, access content, I read children. If looking set forget solution younger kids, it.; Used couple times, much 2 yr old. Then automatically charged without warning. Pretty dumb app.
