Reviews: I love app. It solve several issues once! Simple fun.; Often doesnt let camera move direction want. This big deal dog crate want track pet around room annoying times. Voice feature great. Must reboot make work unresponsive; It took several times pair device Wifi, moment I tried phone went offline happened I liked. I uninstalled re-installed somehow worked first try (new user new profile) working. I wonder, I delete pictures taken? There option delete messages whatsoever. Where pics stored? Update: I uninstall it. It kept sending notifications 10min without using doorbell. Removing batteries solve it. I'll try pair phone later on, situation big disappointment. Update 2: Reinstalled, logged in, doorbell working fine, notifications sent phone.; This cheap IP cameras (Victure, Apeman, Busoth) Amazon. The works fine. It would nice precise directional control camera like Windows app, presets make okay. Edit: To get landscape mode, push little expansion icon bottom right image. The major problem I lack information encryption security. How cameras connect internet EyeCloud gain access cameras outside network, internet? Does relay server somewhere (for example, eyecloud.so Hong Kong) camera kind open port finds it? Is data encrypted internet? If I'm viewing camera device connected camera local network, sense local network directly rather loop internet? If data going relay server, company access live video stream?

The latest software installed. Please help 6 months old.
